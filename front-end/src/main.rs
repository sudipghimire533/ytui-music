/*
* The role of main function is just to spawn two different loop in each thread and again pass
* control to another loop
* 1) handler is a sync thread for event_listener: This thread will wait for user input and respond
*    See ui/event.rs for implementation
* 2) communicate is the sync thread for the communicator which act as the bridge between backend and
*    front-end. It checks for data required, get data from fetcher and also handles the filling of
*    data in respective place
* And the main thread itself will pass the control to `draw_ui` which handles rendering or painting
* to the terminal. This painter function as well as other 2 spawned thread above runs in a loop and
* all those loop and terminated when user hits key to quit the application.
*
* See below files for respective function
* __ui/mod.rs__: Defines structures as well as draw_ui function which render the content. This files
* contains the declaration and abstraction to control the layout, state and related things.
*
* __ui/utils.rs__: This file declares and implements all the definitions in __ui/mod.rs__. This
* includes building the individual components, defining styles and layout, Initializing the state
* and other structs.
*
* __ui/event.rs__: The sole purpose of this file is to wait for user event and responds by either
* updating the ui or by asking the communicator to fill the required data
*
* __communicator.rs__: This file reads the state variable, compares it to previous state and change
* the data to be rendered. This includes calling the fetcher backed, navigating pages and so on.
*
* All the communication required are done via a single state variable which stores the state as
* well as presented data. Given state variable is shared via wrapping in condavr so that one thread
* can notify other thread when it bring some change in state
