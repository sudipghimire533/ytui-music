Ytui music is a cli software that allows you to stream youtube audio online.
The original idea hit me when I found myself opening a whole browser just to listen to music.
Brought to you by a music addict.

Problem ytui music tries to solve:
- Able to stream to youtube audio from cli
- Have a nice basic function like searching and exploring trending content
- Keyboard driven navigation and control
- Download with single key combination key press
- Track my favourites music, playlist and artist in local database

Ytui-music says:
- Do not open a whole browser just to listen to music
- Never let youtube track me through my listening activity
- Works completly on terminal so also runs on ssh without gui
- Playing music should never keep reasources load on system.
- Most of the paramaters are configurable through simple json file
- Music are not made to be interrupted by ads
- Eyes should stay pleased with not-too-bad tui

What you may not find:
- Currently, managing playback queue is the only thing I miss from a full featured music player
- Besides favourites playlist. Maintaining own playlist is also currently not available.
  Instead, you may create a public playlist from official youtube and add those to favourites.
  I am not a guy who manipulates playlist that much. I just few musics to favourites playlist.

Toos used:
mpv: To handle playback. Mpv seems to be only option that integrate well with online streaming.
     Well, many may cheer for vlc but it's online streaming side is less active compared to mpv
sqlite: To store the local data like favourites list. Goto choice for embedded databse for decade
youtube-dl: Everyone knows. youtube-dl handles so well to fetch youtbe-data
rust: Empowering everyone to write efficient software. Well I'm empowered
