                                you want to use global mpv config. You may point this path to the directory where
                                your mpv.conf file is stored.
                                Tip: If you use any other tool instead of youtube-dl but provide same interface.
                                    For instance, ytdlp.
                                    You can specify `youtube-dl` key and point to ytdlp path
